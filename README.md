# csgo_dont_blind_me

This app reduces the screen brightness when flashed in CS:GO.

If you are running *Windows*, I recommend that you get the [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/dev7355608/csgo_dont_blind_me/releases); then you don't need to install anything else. Otherwise, if you are on *Linux* or *macOS*, you would have to have Python 3.5+ installed in order to get up and running.
